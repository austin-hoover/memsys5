# MEMSYS5

This is the source code for the [MEMSYS5 algorithm](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/211/1/111/1026907). The code was downloaded from Steven Gull's [webpage](https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~steve/lisgo/tomography/memsys5/), which no longer exists.

I eventually hope to write a Python interface to the algorithm or to rewrite entirely in Python.
